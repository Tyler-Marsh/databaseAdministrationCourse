# Database-Administration-Project
Relational database design and analysis through SQL


#Project Motivation

I was assigned a database design and data analysis project using SQL. I took this chance to try to answer questions that I always
had about the NFL and betting. Some questions such as "does Vegas increase the Over/Under (expected point total) for games in domes
compared to games played outside during November and on?" and "do teams actually cover the "Over/Under less in freezing weather?".
I compiled 3 seasons worth of regular NFL season games played in America and created a database to answer these questions. Some of the query
results are quite interesting.


#SQL code

Repeatable code was used to establish the database. Any future corrections and editions to the database are easily implemented this way.
The code is labeled as deliverable 2
