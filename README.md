# Database-Administration-Project
Relational database design and analysis through SQL


# Project Motivation

I was assigned a database design and data analysis project using SQL. I took this chance to try to answer questions that I always
had about the NFL and betting. Examples of the questions are "does Vegas increase the Over/Under (expected point total) for games in domes
compared to games played outside during November and on?" and "do teams actually cover the "Over/Under less in freezing weather?".
I compiled 3 seasons worth of regular NFL season games played in America and created a database to answer these questions. Some of the query
results are quite interesting.

# Write up

The project description and overview of the relational database are inside the doc file Tyler_Marsh_Project_Deliverable_2. Here you can
find the description of all the tables, attributes, etc.


# SQL code

Repeatable code was used to establish the database. Any future corrections and editions to the database are easily implemented this way.
The code is labeled as deliverable 2
